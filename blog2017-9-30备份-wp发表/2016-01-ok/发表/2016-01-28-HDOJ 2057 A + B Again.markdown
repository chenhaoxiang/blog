Problem Description
There must be many A + B problems in our HDOJ , now a new one is coming.
Give you two hexadecimal integers , your task is to calculate the sum of them,and print it in hexadecimal too.
Easy ? AC it !
 

Input
The input contains several test cases, please process to the end of the file.
Each case consists of two hexadecimal integers A and B in a line seperated by a blank.
The length of A and B is less than 15.
 

Output
For each test case,print the sum of A and B in hexadecimal in one line.

 

Sample Input
+A -A
+1A 12
1A -9
-1A -12
1A -AA
 

Sample Output
0
2C
11

-90


```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		while(sc.hasNext()){
			long str1 = sc.nextLong(16);
			long str2 = sc.nextLong(16);
			long a = str1+str2;
			if(a&#60;0){
				//System.out.println(a);
				a=-a;
				//System.out.println(a);
				System.out.println("-"+Long.toHexString(a).toUpperCase());
			}else{
				System.out.println(Long.toHexString(a).toUpperCase());
			}
		}
	}

}
