----------

**Problem Description**
As part of an arithmetic competency program, your students will be given randomly generated lists of from 2 to 15 unique positive integers and asked to determine how many items in each list are twice some other item in the same list. You will need a program to help you with the grading. This program should be able to scan the lists and output the correct answer for each one. For example, given the list 
1 4 3 2 9 7 18 22

your program should answer 3, as 2 is twice 1, 4 is twice 2, and 18 is twice 9. 

 

**Input**
The input file will consist of one or more lists of numbers. There will be one list of numbers per line. Each list will contain from 2 to 15 unique positive integers. No integer will be larger than 99. Each line will be terminated with the integer 0, which is not considered part of the list. A line with the single number -1 will mark the end of the file. The example input below shows 3 separate lists. Some lists may not contain any doubles.

 

**Output**
The output will consist of one line per input list, containing a count of the items that are double some other item.

 

**Sample Input**
1 4 3 2 9 7 18 22 0
2 4 8 10 0
7 5 11 13 1 3 0
-1 
 

**Sample Output**
3
2
0


题意：就是判断输入的一行数中，有多少对数字相差2倍。
输入的数据不会有重复的。

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		while(sc.hasNext()){
			String strNum = sc.nextLine();
			String[] strsNum = strNum.split(" ");
			int[] num = new int[strsNum.length];
			for(int i=0;i&#60;strsNum.length;i++){
				num[i] = Integer.parseInt(strsNum[i]);
			}
			if(num[0]==-1){
				return ;
			}
			
			int t=0;
			for(int i=0;i&#60;num.length;i++){
				for(int j=0;j&#60;num.length;j++){
					if(i!=j){
						//注意除数不能为0！
						if(num[j]!=0){
							double two = (num[i]*1.0)/(1.0*num[j]);
							if(two==2){
							    t++;
						    	break;
						    }
						}
					}
				}
			}
			System.out.println(t);
		}
	}

}

```
