Problem Description
Write a program to determine the summation of several sets of integers.

 

Input
The input file will consist of up to 250 sets of integers, where each set contains at most 100 integers and the integer values will be between –16000 and + 16000. Each set of numbers is started with the number of integers in the set, n. The next n input lines will each contain one integer of the set. You should stop processing when the size of the set, n, is>= 0. 
 

Output
A single line of output should be generated for each set of integers. The line should have format shown below.

 

Sample Input
4
-1
3
1
1
2
19
17
5
-645
952
-1488
-5456
-9342
-1
 

Sample Output
Sum of #1 is 4
Sum of #2 is 36
Sum of #3 is -15979



**简单题，就是求和。**

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main{

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int t=0;
		while(sc.hasNext()){
			int n =sc.nextInt();
			if(n==-1){
				break;
			}
			long  sum=0;
			for(int i=0;i&#60;n;i++){
				long a = sc.nextLong();
				sum+=a;
			}
			System.out.println("Sum of #"+(++t)+" is "+sum);
		}
	}
}

```
