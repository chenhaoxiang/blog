写这篇博客的目的，只是希望大家能够知道，这种类似的邮件与信息是诈骗的，至于她能骗到你什么，请看下去。

前几天收到那封英文邮件的时候，真的，完全看不出这是个诈骗邮件，我很认真的和她来往了3封邮件。大家请看：

最开始的她对我发的邮件与我的回复邮件：

![](http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160831225335289)
她的来信大概意思是：

我的回信大概意思：


你好，亲爱的Jovita Gomez小姐，很惊讶地收到你的邮件，
我也很高兴有你这个朋友，我不知道如何表达我的快乐，总之，我很高兴。
你是第一个CSDN博客通过我的邮件给我的外国朋友。我希望尽快收到你的来信。
陈浩翔


我很认真，很认真的回了她！

然后继续收到她的来信：
下面的邮件比较长，我直接用文字了，就不截图了。

大概意思就是她是哪里的，因为商业，她的父母和兄弟被人追杀而死，然后父母留下了570万美元，说是要转给我，需要我提供一些证明，说下次来信会给我发她的照片，希望收到我的回信啥的，当时第一次没看懂，然后我又很认真的回了她：

![](http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160831225947518)
翻译过来，大概意思是：


亲爱的小姐，Jovita Gomez，你好，首先很高兴听到你的回信。
我的英语不是很好，也许有些地方不合理的说法，请原谅我。
看到你的回复，我对你的家人遭遇感到很抱歉。你现在还好吗？我希望你一切都好。我期待着你来到我的国家，我对你上一个邮件的消息，不是很清楚，我有什么可以帮你吗？我很乐意帮助你。
你的朋友：
陈浩翔


于是她又回了我，她的原文：

大概意思就是，她现在是用她那里牧师的电脑给我发邮件，每天能用3次，还告诉了我她那里的牧师的电话(我特意查了一下，塞内瓦尔的电话区号的确是2217)，说要我给出让她能信服的东西，希望我提供我的国家，具体地址，电话，照片，她会联系银行，给我转账...然后附件给我发了她的2张照片。

![](http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160831231021944)

当时我确实懵了一B，银行账户都没问我，你怎么给我转账哈~
哈哈，开个小玩笑。

当时我只是有点怀疑，然后打算百度一下，于是，我直接百度"senegal邮件诈骗",然后，你们看：

![](http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160831231158550)

![](http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160831231207445)

还有很多，点了一篇进去看了一下。

![](http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160831231251758)

哈哈，原因改了，不过结果还是给我们转钱，
可能有人要问，既然是给我们转钱，她怎么转钱啊。

嗯~手续费可不便宜哦，
大家看一下各大银行的国际汇款手续费：
![](http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160831231538385)
嗯，这是2010年的，手续费应该现在上涨了吧。

到时候她会用手续费的原因来要求你先汇手续费给她，然后她才能把钱转过了，因为她在有一封邮件说了，她那里在贫民区无法取钱！！！！无法取钱！！！所以咯，推理一下，只能是你付手续费咯。

对于她开始说，我帮助她，就能得到她那570W美元的百分之20的时候，我就有点怀疑了。不过当时可能自己心里带着点，万一是真的呢，哈哈，当时自己也是贪心了。不过她索要我的个人信息时，我就百度了一下，没等到她向我要手续费就拆穿了这个诈骗，哈哈。

也许她最后需要的不是手续费，不过也差不多啦，肯定到最后是你出钱的，她会找各种理由，这点勿需置疑。
好啦，写了这么多，只希望大家不要被骗了，虽然1-2百不是什么大事，但是影响心情，不是吗。
只要记住，天下没有这么掉馅饼的事啦。

希望大伙都能不被骗，嘿嘿~

然后，在博乐群，问了一下，发现还有几个朋友这几天遇到一样的情况，应该是CSDN网站内的邮箱被爬取了。
